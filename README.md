# logr
Bunyan / Pino Logger instance ready to use

Bunyan is really great for debugging purposes but Pino is crazily fast.

Thinking about that this package was created to use Bunyan whenever the
LOG_LEVEL environmental variable is set to ```debug``` or ```trace```;

## INSTALL

    npm install em-loger --save

## USAGE

    const logr = require('em-logr');
